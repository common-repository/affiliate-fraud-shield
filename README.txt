__Detect Fraud and Increase the Profitability of Affiliate Marketing__

Online advertising can mean life or death for an e-commerce merchant. Advertising can be a way to increase sales as well as a source of fraud.

Fraud resulting from unsavory affiliate marketing techniques increases the likelihood of chargebacks and revenue loss.

Our **Affiliate Fraud Alerts** helps merchants identify campaign threats before they become liabilities.

__Affiliate Fraud Causes Chargebacks__

There are two primary affiliate fraud techniques that can lead to chargebacks:

___Using stolen credit card information to facilitate illegitimate affiliate sales.___
When the cardholder learns of the unauthorized transaction and files a chargeback, the merchant becomes the victim.

___Perpetrating a bait-and-switch.___
Unscrupulous affiliates will make promises the merchant can’t keep. When consumers learned they’ve been duped, they file chargebacks.

**Chargebacks911’s Affiliate Fraud Alerts** are designed to detect and prevent the most commonly perpetrated forms of affiliate fraud.

A Word of Warning: Even if your business isn’t experiencing affiliate fraud-induced chargebacks, your profitability is still in grave danger. There are different types of affiliate fraud—some result in chargebacks and some don’t. Even if these transactions aren’t disputed, the fraud can still destroy your business by stealing revenue and profits.

Let **Chargebacks911** show you how **Affiliate Fraud Alerts** can protect your bottom line from all types of revenue-stealing fraud.

= What does the AFS-Loader plugin do? =

When a customer orders a product from your website, information about the sale is transmitted to a database where it is
stored for analysis. The customer's payment information is stripped so that it does not include the security code, 
expiration date, or full card number.

Using this information, AFS will detect and prevent the most commonly perpetrated forms of affiliate fraud which can lead
to chargebacks and forteited processing rights.

= How does the AFS-Loader plugin work? =

The plugin is a generic loader which links to the same public javascript file located here:

	https://afs.chargebacks911.com/js/shield.js

When this script is loaded, Wordpress passes your API KEY and API TYPE to the script. When your API Key is assigned, our 
developers will review your website and determine which "Type" of operation will be necessary to capture your order data,
or to create a new "Type" that only applies to you. 

When a customer comes to your website and makes a purchase request, in most cases they will fill in an order form or
pass through a succession of order forms which collect the order data, customer, shipping and payment information.

At checkout, a copy of this information (without the card security code, expiration date, or full card number) is
transmitted to the Affiliate Fraud Shield API.

This information is then analyzed to detect suspicious activity that may lead to chargebacks or other problems, and
you can be notified before fulfilling the sale.
